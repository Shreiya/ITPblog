            <p>Her Long Black Hair is nothing short of an ethereal audio dream in which you're physically in one dimension, but over those 40 odd minutes - your mind defies all theories of time and relativity, and travels far into another time and world, only to come back so you can create clear demarcations between the 'is' and 'was'.</p>

            <p>Never having heard of the concept of a soundwalk before, I should be completely honest by giving the reader full disclosure that if you find yourself in the same position as me, this will change everything you know about audio simulated experiences.</p>

            <p>To begin with the pitter patter of footsteps in dewy surroundings <i>(note: this circumstantial detail isn't dislosed by the speaker)</i>, lent the first effect which was created by a voice but led to a visual creation in the mind. What was magical though, was the fact that I'd never felt the possibility of creating two parallel visual observation of the same surroundings within the same moment.</p>

            <p>From a strictly learning-to-implement point of view though, there was much to learn from the process followed to merge the narrative - its modulation to showcase intense and soft tones, with her footsteps and natural habitat.</p>

            <p>All in all, if there was something to take back, it was to implement a similar process to be able to transport the listener to another world while reminding them of their presence in the current one. It's a difficult outcome to achieve, but so well worth working for. Anything magical is.</p>

              <p>Let's enter a time machine.</p>

              <p>Let's touch upon a musical genius from the 60s.</p>

              <p>Let's mention one of his hits, sparking a bit of nostalgia in the mind.</p>

              <p>Let's change everything you thought was right about the world.</p>

            <h3 style="color:lime">tl:dr</h3>
            <blockquote><h4>
            Remixing is the basic element of all forms of creativity.</h4>
          </blockquote>

        </br>

            <p>Point me in the direction of a completely new, original, and unheard idea that holds no relation to one devised in the path and I'll start believing again.</p>
            <p>There isn't a single line that Kirby Ferguson spoke that could be deemed as deranged. He mentions examples of rythmes and tunes 'inspired' by those from the past as well some amalgamted with others to create 'new' sounds.</p>

            <blockquote>"Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property, but it's property that we're all building on, and creations can only take root and grow once that ground has been prepared."</blockquote>

            <p>Again, tell me one word in the above statement that doesn't resonate with every new concept that you might have come up with. But then again, the world doesn't really work on open source grounds. We live in a camouflaged rat race where in every respect, a hierarchy has to be established. And that's when we realise that it isn't content that's king. Patent is.</p>

          <blockquote>
            The power of the patent holds greater authority over the power of invention and creativity. The examples cited by Kirby Ferguson lay testimony to that fact. In today's date, to own an idea is far more dangerous than implementing it.
          </blockquote>

          <p>At the end of the day, I feel that along with passing a vital piece of information along, this piece is Kirby's plea to us to be a little more forgiving and understanding of the creative processes followed by human nature in general.</p>

          <blockquote><h3>Cryptomnesia : An interesting illusion which turned into the convenient 'now'.</h3></blockquote>

          <p>The power of appropriation takes control of us in ways we may not realise. We consider an idea to be the child of a magnificent brainwave, the kind that only hits after weeks of research, planning, and structure. What we don't consider is our inability to come to terms with the fact that <i>every</i> idea that we will ever come up with, will always be an adopted grandchild of someone else's previously adopted and well thought out brainchild.</p>
