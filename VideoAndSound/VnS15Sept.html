            <p>Her Long Black Hair is nothing short of an etheral audio dream in which you're physically in one dimension, but over those 40 odd minutes - your mind defies all theories of time and relativity, and travels far into another time and world, only to come back so you can create clear demarcations between the 'is' and 'was'.</p>

            <p>Never having heard of the concept of a soundwalk before, I should be completely honest by giving the reader full disclosure that if you find yourself in the same position as me, this will change everything you know about audio simulated experiences.</p>

            <p>To begin with the pitter patter of footsteps in dewy surroundings <i>(note: this circumstantial detail isn't dislosed by the speaker)</i>, lent the first effect which was created by a voice but led to a visual creation in the mind. What was magical though, was the fact that I'd never felt the possibility of creating two parallel visual observation of the same surroundings within the same moment.</p>

            <p>From a strictly learning-to-implement point of view though, there was much to learn from the process followed to merge the narrative - its modulation to showcase intense and soft tones, with her footsteps and natural habitat.</p>

            <p>All in all, if there was something to take back, it was to implement a similar process to be able to transport the listener to another world while reminding them of their presence in the current one. It's a difficult outcome to achieve, but so well worth working for. Anything magical is.</p>
